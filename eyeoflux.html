		<p><font color="red">The Crying Lamb: A Tale of Cosmic Madness</font></p>
		<p>Before the Cult of Aeternum Animus tore the fabric of reality and rewrote the laws of existence,</p>
		<p>there was a lamb—an ordinary creature, or so it seemed. Born under a crimson sky that bled into </p>
		<p>the snow-covered earth, the lamb was an omen, a fracture in the mundane, a vessel for something </p>
		<p>far beyond comprehension.</p>

		<p>Its cries began the night it took its first breath. But these were no ordinary cries. They weren’t</p>
		<p>sounds; they were vibrations that echoed through the minds of all who heard them, unraveling sanity</p>
		<p>and opening doors no mortal was meant to open. The villagers claimed they heard voices within the</p>
		<p>cries—whispers of a thousand lifetimes, of infinite universes collapsing into one.</p>

		<p>Then the incident happened.</p>

		<p>The lamb had wandered into the fields one freezing night, its tiny hooves cracking the icy ground.</p>
		<p>By morning, the shepherds found it standing atop a dead ewe, its mouth gaping wide, pouring out streams </p>
		<p>of green mist that shimmered like living veins. Around it, hundreds of ravens perched silently, their eyes </p>
		<p>glowing like burning coals, staring into the void.</p>

		<p>The mist seemed alive, weaving and writhing like serpents, and the air was filled with a deafening,</p>
		<p>incomprehensible hum. It wasn’t coming from the lamb—it was coming through it, as if something vast, </p>
		<p>ancient, and unspeakable was pressing against the thin membrane of reality, trying to force its way through.</p>

		<p>The shepherds fled, but one returned, drawn by a voice in his head. It was the voice of the lamb, but</p>
		<p>it spoke words too vast for human language. His mind shattered, reforming in an instant. He fell to his</p>
		<p>knees, his eyes rolling back as he screamed:</p>

		<p>"The Eternal Spirit! The Infinite Flame! Aeternum Animus calls us! Reality is a lie! Bow before the cycle,</p>
		<p>or be consumed by it!"</p>

		<p>From that day forward, the lamb became more than an animal. Its cries grew louder, warping the minds of</p>
		<p>all who heard them. Villagers began to gather, speaking in tongues, chanting its name—though they didn’t</p>
		<p>remember learning it. The air around the lamb shimmered like heatwaves, and the snow beneath it turned to ash.</p>

		<p>Reality itself began to bend.</p>

		<p>The ravens multiplied, their forms twisting into grotesque amalgamations of beaks, wings, and eyes, their cries</p>
		<p>harmonizing with the lamb’s. Shadows began to grow teeth. The dead ewe rose from the ground, its empty eyesockets</p>
		<p>glowing with a sickly green light, and stood beside the lamb like a guardian.</p>

		<p>The shepherd who first listened became known as Primus Aeternum, the Chosen Vessel. His body was no longer his</p>
		<p>own—he was a puppet of the eternal spirit. He declared that the lamb was the Harbinger of the New Aeon, the</p>
		<p>gateway through which Aeternum Animus would merge all realities into one.</p>

		<p>The Cult of Aeternum Animus was born that day, and its mission was clear: consume the illusion of reality</p>
		<p>and make all things one with the eternal spirit.</p>
