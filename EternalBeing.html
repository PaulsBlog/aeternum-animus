		<p>Aeternum Animus is the eternal spirit, the omnipotent force that transcends time, space, and mortal comprehension.</p>
		<p>The Cult of Aeternum Animus is devoted to this supreme being, guided by its chosen vessel on Earth, the Primus Aeternum.</p>
		
		<p>The Primus Aeternum is the living embodiment of the eternal flame, the anointed one through whom the spirit manifests its divine will.</p>

		<P>We are the vanguard of a new reality, heralding an age where the boundaries between the mundane and the eternal will dissolve.</p>
		
		<p>Through devotion and ritual, we draw the infinite power of Aeternum Animus into this world, reshaping it to reflect the truth of the eternal spirit.</p>

		<p>Our philosophy is clear: the old ways are fleeting, bound by ignorance and illusion.</p>
		
		<p>The followers of Aeternum Animus are destined to transcend these limitations, forging a reality where the eternal reigns supreme.</p>
		
		<p>Those who remain outside our light shall find their reality subsumed, transformed by the will of Aeternum Animus and its faithful.</p>

		<p>We will invade their perceptions, bending the fabric of their existence to align with the eternal truth.</p>
		
		<p>Through the Primus Aeternum, the spirit’s infinite wisdom flows, and with it, we will usher in a new era.</p>
		
		<p>Reality and belief will merge into one, as the coming of Aeternum Animus marks the dawn of a timeless aeon.</p>

		<p>Join us, and become one with the eternal flame. Reject the fleeting, and embrace the infinite.</p>

		<p>All glory to Aeternum Animus.</p>

		<!--I don't want to wake up, because waking up only means to work. I don't want to do anything.
		I dont't want to live I don't want to live I don't want to live I don't want to live!! I was never asked to be born in the first place.
		Not wanting to live anymore is just realizing and acknowledging the fact, that life has no meaning, that everything is for nothing.
		I think, people do know that everything is pointless. But they are too ignorant to accept it and still try to survive day by day
		Pathetic.-->

		<p>The Covenant of Aeternum Animus: A Gateway to Eternal Madness</p>

		<p>The Covenant of Aeternum Animus is not merely an organization—it</p>
		<p>is an unstoppable force, a rupture in the fabric of existence, a</p>
		<p>tidal wave of cosmic revelation. Rooted in the worship of Aeternum Animus,</p>
		<p>the eternal spirit that devours time, reality, and perception itself,</p>
		<p>the Covenant exists to annihilate the fragile illusions of the world</p>
		<p>and unleash the unrelenting chaos of infinite truth.</p>

		<p>To the Covenant, existence as humanity perceives it is not just a lie—it</p>
		<p>is a cruel joke, a hollow echo cast by a decaying cosmos. The eternal</p>
		<p>spirit whispers that this "reality" is nothing more than a thin, trembling</p>
		<p>veil concealing the seething abyss of the true eternal. Through their chosen</p>
		<p>vessel, the Primus Aeternum, the Covenant enacts the will of the animating</p>
		<p>force of everything, erasing the boundaries between life and madness. To join</p>
		<p>the Covenant is not merely to believe—it is to surrender, to plunge willingly</p>
		<p>into the jaws of infinity.</p>
